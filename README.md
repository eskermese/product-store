# What is going on there
What does the client do:
- sending address to download products (for example, run project <a href="github.com/ernur-eskermes/lead-csv-service/">lead-csv-service</a>)
- requesting products with pagination functionality (page, size)
- requesting products continuously, simulate endless loading (based on bidirectional-stream)

What does the server do:
- going to the url, download and save the csv-file, extract the products from it, save to your database
- giving products with pagination functionality (page, size)
- giving away products in stream

Services are raised in docker-compose, the client starts and executes requests with output to the console, and then exits.  
The server continues to work
